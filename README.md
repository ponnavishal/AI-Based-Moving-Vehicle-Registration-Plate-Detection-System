AI-Based Moving Vehicle Detection System Integrated with Vehicle Owner Details

Project Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered system for detecting moving vehicles and retrieving their owner details. The system utilizes computer vision techniques and a database integration to identify vehicles in real-time and fetch corresponding ownership information.

Features

Real-time vehicle detection using AI and deep learning

License plate recognition for identifying vehicle details

Integration with a database for retrieving owner information

User-friendly interface for searching vehicle details

Alert system for unauthorized or suspicious vehicles

Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV (Computer Vision)

TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning)

YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for license plate detection

Flask/Django (Backend for API and UI)

MySQL/PostgreSQL (Database for storing vehicle details)

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-vehicle-detection.git
cd ai-vehicle-detection

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up the database and import vehicle owner details.

Run the application:

python app.py

Usage

Start the application and access the UI.

Upload or stream a video containing moving vehicles.

The system detects vehicles and extracts license plates.

Owner details are retrieved and displayed from the database.

Future Enhancements

Integration with government vehicle databases

Mobile application support

Cloud-based real-time vehicle tracking
